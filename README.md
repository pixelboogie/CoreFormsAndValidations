# CoreFormsAndValidations

## Description
CoreFormsAndValidations is a project developed as part of the Coursera course for the ".NET FullStack Developer Specialization" certification. This project focuses on creating and handling forms in ASP.NET Core, with a particular emphasis on implementing form validations.

Forms are an essential component of any web application, and ASP.NET Core offers a straightforward way to create and manage them using various features. In this project, you'll learn about different types of forms in ASP.NET Core, including loosely typed and strongly typed forms, and how to handle them using model binding.

Additionally, the project covers both server-side and client-side form validations to ensure that user inputs are correct and accurate. You'll also explore how to implement custom validations to meet specific requirements, ensuring that your forms handle data efficiently and securely.
